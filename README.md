Android Native Development Kit (NDK)
====================================

The NDK allows Android application developers to include
native code in their Android application packages, compiled as JNI shared
libraries.

 * User documentation is available on the [Android Developer website].
 * Discussions related to the Android NDK happen on the [android-ndk Google
   Group].
 * File bugs against the NDK at https://github.com/android-ndk/ndk/issues.



If you want to work _on_ the NDK itself rather than just use it, see the NDK team's
[internal documentation](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/README.md).
